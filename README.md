## Installation

### Preferred: Via Composer
Assuming your WordPress install is managed via Composer, you can simply require this plugin, which will also install dependencies (CMB2). Then be sure to activate the installed CMB2 plugin.

### Via WP Admin
Alternatively, you can install this plugin by uploading a zip into the WordPress admin as you normally would.

You should then manually install and activate the CMB2 plugin.
